Hello and Welcome to My-Best-Friend-Website !
The story:
my best friend website is very cute and useful website where you can check some of the dog's breed , their size, training, and a whole other stuff about them.

i have used a basic knowledge of HTML-CSS to build this website like ( a tag, h tags, img and other HTML tags ).
and for the CSS i styled the contact using ( color,height-weight, padding , margin, and other CSS styling properties ).
i have also used the classes attribute with the div which made it a lot easier to style the content the way i want it to look like .

the website was made by "Ahmed AlSalihi"
