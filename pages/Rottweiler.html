    <p class="descrption">The Rottweiler is a robust, powerful, and loyal breed, often recognized for its protective nature. They're versatile dogs, known for their intelligence and ability to perform various roles, from service dogs and police dogs to companions.
<br>
        Size: Rottweilers are a large breed. Adult males typically stand 24 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 95 to 135 pounds. Females are slightly smaller, usually standing 22 to 25 inches tall and weighing between 80 to 100 pounds.
        <br>
        Appearance: Rottweilers are solid, substantial dogs with a muscular build. They have a broad head with a rounded forehead and a deep chest. Their eyes are of medium size, almond-shaped, and dark brown in color. Rottweilers have medium-sized ears that lie flat and close to the cheek. Their glossy coat is straight and coarse, with noticeable rust to mahogany markings on a black base.
        <br>
        Coat and Color: The Rottweiler has a short, double coat that's usually black with clearly defined rust or mahogany markings. The undercoat is found mainly on the neck and thighs. The placement of the markings is well defined, appearing over the eyes, on the cheeks, muzzle, chest, legs, and beneath the tail.
        <br>
        Personality: Rottweilers are known for their loyal and protective nature. They're typically confident, calm, and courageous, with a self-assured aloofness that doesn't lend itself to immediate friendships. However, with their family, Rottweilers are loving and affectionate. Proper socialization from a young age is crucial to prevent over-protectiveness and aggression.
        <br>
        Exercise and Health: As an active and robust breed, Rottweilers require regular exercise and mental stimulation. Without it, they can become bored and destructive. They're generally healthy but can be prone to certain health conditions like hip and elbow dysplasia, heart conditions, and certain types of cancer.
        <br>
        Training: Rottweilers are highly intelligent and responsive, making them relatively easy to train. Consistent, positive reinforcement training methods are most effective with this breed. They can excel in various dog sports, obedience, agility, and working roles.
        <br>
        Overall, Rottweilers are protective, strong, and steadfast, making excellent companions for those who appreciate their protective nature. Their loyal and loving demeanor towards their family, paired with their bravery and intelligence, make them a versatile breed for work or companionship.</p>
