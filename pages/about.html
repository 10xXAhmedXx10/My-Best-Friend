<h2 class="story">The story:</h2>

<p class="the-story"> my best friend website is very cute and useful website where you can check some of the dog's breed , their size, training, and a whole other stuff about them.</p>

<p class="the-story2">i have used a basic knowledge of HTML-CSS to build this website like (  a  tag, h tags, img and other HTML tags ). <br>
    and for the CSS i styled the contact using ( color,height-weight, padding , margin, and other CSS styling properties ). <br>
    i have also used the classes attribute with the div which made it a lot easier to style the content the way i want it to look like .
</p>

<p class="the-story2">the website was made by "Ahmed AlSalihi"</p>

<p class="thankyou">Thank you so much for visiting the website</p>
