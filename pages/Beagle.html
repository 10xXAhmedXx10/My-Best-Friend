    <p class="descrption">The Beagle is a small to medium-sized breed known for its keen sense of smell, friendly disposition, and distinctive baying bark.
<br>
        Size: Beagles come in two size groups, according to the American Kennel Club: those under 13 inches tall at the shoulder and those between 13 and 15 inches. They typically weigh between 20 to 30 pounds, making them an ideal size for many homes.
        <br>
        Appearance: Beagles have a compact and muscular body, a square muzzle, and a medium-length tail that is carried high. Their eyes are usually brown or hazel and have a characteristic hound expression, which is pleading and soft. Their ears are long and soft, hanging down the side of their heads.
        <br>
        Coat and Color: Beagles have a dense double coat that is weather-resistant. It's usually tricolored (most commonly black, brown, and white), but they can also be found in various "hound colors," including different shades of tan, red, lemon, and white.
        <br>
        Personality: Known for their merry and friendly nature, Beagles get along well with other dogs and children, making them excellent family pets. They are curious and determined, traits that were bred into them for tracking scents during hunts.
        <br>
        Exercise and Health: Beagles are an active breed that requires regular exercise to keep them fit and prevent obesity. They love to play and go on walks, especially if they can follow a scent. Health-wise, they're generally a robust breed, but can be prone to certain conditions like epilepsy, hypothyroidism, and hip dysplasia.
        <br>
        Training: Beagles are intelligent, but their determined and independent nature can sometimes make training a challenge. Consistent, positive reinforcement methods work best with this breed.
        <br>
        The Beagle's small size, combined with its friendly and outgoing temperament, make it a popular choice for families. They're social dogs who enjoy company, and their love of play makes them especially good for active households.</p>
