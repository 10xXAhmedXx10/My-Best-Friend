    <p class="descrption">The Boxer is a medium to large-sized breed of working dog that's well known for its muscular build, short hair, and distinctive square-shaped head.
<br>
        Size: Adult Boxers typically stand at 23 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder for males, and 21.5 to 23.5 inches for females. Their weight can range from 65 to 80 pounds in males, and 50 to 65 pounds in females.
        <br>
        Appearance: Boxers have a strong, muscular, and compact build. Their heads are proportionate to their bodies and they have a distinctive square muzzle. Boxers have dark brown eyes and their ears are usually cropped to stand erect (though cropping is becoming less popular and is banned in some countries). Their tails are typically docked, but undocked tails are slightly curved and taper to a point.
        <br>
        Coat and Color: Boxers have a short, shiny, and smooth coat that lies tight to their body. The breed is recognized in two color variations: fawn (which can range from a light tan to a deep, rich red) and brindle (which is a striped overlay on the fawn base). They often have white markings, sometimes covering up to one-third of their body.
        <br>
        Personality: Boxers are known for their playful, energetic, and friendly disposition. They are excellent with children and they often get along well with other household pets. Despite their high energy levels and need for physical exercise, they also enjoy relaxing with their human companions.
        <br>
        Exercise and Health: As an active and athletic breed, Boxers require regular exercise to maintain their muscle tone and to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors. They are prone to certain health conditions like hip dysplasia, heart conditions, and certain cancers. They're also sensitive to extreme temperatures, especially heat, due to their short muzzle.
        <br>
        Training: Boxers are intelligent and learn new commands quickly, but they can be stubborn. Positive reinforcement training methods work best for this breed. Early socialization and obedience training are essential to raise a well-rounded dog.
        <br>
        Overall, Boxers are fun-loving, affectionate, and loyal dogs that make a great addition to active families. Their protective nature also makes them effective watchdogs.</p>
