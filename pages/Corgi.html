    <p class="descrption">The term "Corgi" refers to two separate breeds: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. While there are differences between the two, they share many traits, and are both well-known for their short legs, long bodies, and oversized ears. For this description, we'll focus on the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, which is the more common of the two.
<br>
        Size: Pembrokes are small to medium-sized dogs. They typically weigh between 24 to 30 pounds for males, and 24 to 28 pounds for females. Despite their small stature, they are sturdy and strong.
        <br>
        Appearance: Pembrokes are known for their short legs, long bodies, and large, erect ears that are in proportion to their head. They have a fox-like expression with intelligent, slightly rounded eyes that are usually brown. Their bodies are strong and muscular, showing their heritage as herding dogs.
        <br>
        Coat and Color: Pembrokes have a double coat, with a dense undercoat and a longer topcoat. Their coat is usually straight and of medium length. Coat colors can range from red, sable, fawn, or black and tan, often with white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, belly, and tail.
        <br>
        Personality: Pembroke Welsh Corgis are known for their friendly, intelligent, and playful nature. They are also known to be strong-willed but are generally eager to please their owners. They tend to get along well with children and other animals, although, like many herding breeds, they might attempt to herd family members.
        <br>
        Exercise and Health: Pembrokes are active dogs that require regular physical and mental stimulation. Regular walks, playtime, and access to a safe outdoor area can usually meet their exercise needs. They are generally healthy but are prone to certain health issues like hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and obesity.
        <br>
        Training: Pembrokes are intelligent and can learn quickly, making training usually straightforward. However, their independent nature can sometimes make them a bit stubborn, so it's important to use consistent, positive reinforcement methods. Early socialization and obedience training are important for this breed.
        <br>
        In summary, Pembroke Welsh Corgis are lovable, intelligent, and active dogs with a strong desire to please. Their unique appearance and charming personality make them popular pets. They can be a great fit for families, individuals, or seniors, as long as they receive the exercise and mental stimulation they need.</p>
