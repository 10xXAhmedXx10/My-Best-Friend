<br>
         Size: Adult Labradors typically stand at 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder for males, and 21.5 to 23.5 inches for females. Their weight ranges between 55 to 80 pounds for males and 55 to 70 pounds for females, depending on individual and dietary habits.
        <br>
        Appearance: Labradors have a sturdy and athletic build, which is ideal for a breed that was originally bred for physically demanding work. They possess a wide head with expressive eyes that can be brown or hazel, and their ears hang close to their head. One notable characteristic is their otter-like tail, which is thick at the base and tapers towards the end, often wagging with enthusiasm.

        Coat and Color: They have a short, dense coat that is water-resistant, enabling them to work in various weather conditions. The coat comes in three recognized colors: black, yellow, and chocolate.
        <br>
        Personality: Labradors are renowned for their good nature. They are outgoing, even-tempered, and gentle with a strong desire to please their owners, making them excellent family pets. Their intelligence and eagerness to learn make them highly trainable and often seen in roles such as service dogs or in other working capacities.

        Exercise and Health: This breed is quite active, requiring daily exercise to keep them healthy and content. Labs are generally healthy, but they can be prone to certain conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia, eye conditions, and obesity, especially if they're not given adequate exercise or are overfed.
