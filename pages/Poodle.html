    <p class="descrption">Poodles are an iconic breed, known for their distinctive curly coats, intelligent and affable personality, and their variety of sizes.
<br>
        Size: Poodles come in three sizes, all of which are officially recognized. The Toy Poodle typically stands up to 10 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs about 6 to 9 pounds. The Miniature Poodle stands about 11 to 15 inches tall and weighs about 15 to 17 pounds. The Standard Poodle is considerably larger, standing over 15 inches tall, often up to 22 inches, and weighs anywhere from 45 to 70 pounds.
        <br>
        Appearance: Regardless of size, Poodles have a well-proportioned and square-shaped body with a long, straight muzzle. Their eyes are usually dark and oval-shaped, and they carry their high-set ears close to their head. Their most distinctive feature is their dense, curly or corded coat.
        <br>
        Coat and Color: Poodles are famous for their hypoallergenic coats, which can be a great choice for people with allergies. The coat is dense and can be styled in numerous ways for show dogs, but pets often have a simpler "puppy" cut. Poodles can come in a variety of solid colors, including but not limited to black, white, grey, brown, apricot, and cream.
        <br>
        Personality: Poodles are known for their intelligence and their lively, outgoing, and loving nature. They are often good with children and other animals, and they adapt well to a variety of living conditions. They're typically sociable dogs who get along well with other animals and people.
        <br>
        Exercise and Health: Poodles are active dogs that require daily physical and mental stimulation. Walking, playing, and offering puzzles or toys can keep them happy and healthy. They are generally a healthy breed, but they can be susceptible to certain breed-specific health issues like hip dysplasia, eye disorders, and certain skin conditions.
        <br>
        Training: Thanks to their intelligence, Poodles are typically easy to train. They are eager to please their humans and can excel in various dog sports such as agility, obedience, tracking, and even herding.
        <br>
        In general, Poodles are sophisticated dogs known for their good looks and intelligence. Regardless of size, they make wonderful companions and add a touch of elegance to any home they join.</p>
